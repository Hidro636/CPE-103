Remarks:
    Building the tests themselves was pretty straightforward, but there was a 
lot of natural variation in the times of single push and pop operations on both 
the BadStack and our previous O(1) stack. As a result, it was necessary to use 
the average values of each push/pop over N trials as opposed to just the single 
time for each operation.

    Interestingly, the O(1) push operation had the longest run time for a single
operation, and then spiked at 10 operations due to the first resizing of the 
array (although it did not affect the average time too much). As expected, the
O(1) values approached a lower, constant value as the impact on timing by 
external sources became less of a factor. It may be beneficial to run the
desired operation for a while before beginning timing to help clear out some of
initial long time issues. Both O(1) operations seemed to approach 600ns (running
on the unix servers). The O(N) operations increased, as expected, as well. Apart
from a decrease initially (again, due to reasons not factored into the timing
setup), their times grew linearly like they should. Again, both approached the
same value as the array grew in size, which was about 75000ns/operation.

    There wasn't much out of the ordinary- long times for low numbers of
iterations is expected, and everything grew or decreased in the way that they
should have.
